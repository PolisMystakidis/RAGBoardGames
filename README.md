# RAG practice project
This is a project for practicing using RAG systems on english PDF files so I can finally use it on greek PDF files.
 You need to install Ollama to run https://ollama.com. <br />
 Once you download it run on cmd <br />
**ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest** <br />

for the embeddings model and  <br />
**ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b** <br />

for the text generator model. <br />
